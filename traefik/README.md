# Traefik - Personal Cinema

This section covers the use of **Traefik** within the production environment of the **Personal Cinema** project. Traefik is employed as a reverse proxy and load balancer, enabling secure communication between the various services and managing incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

## Overview

Traefik is an open-source edge router that manages all incoming traffic to the services in the Personal Cinema infrastructure. It acts as a gateway, ensuring that each service is accessible under the correct domain and port, and it facilitates automatic SSL certificate generation and renewal through Let's Encrypt.

## Key Features

- **Routing**: Routes HTTP and HTTPS requests to the appropriate services within the Docker infrastructure.
- **SSL Termination**: Automatically generates and renews SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt, providing secure HTTPS connections.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Automatically detects changes in service configurations through Docker, making it easy to manage deployments.
- **Monitoring**: Includes an optional dashboard for monitoring traffic and the health of services.

## Role in Personal Cinema

In the Personal Cinema project, Traefik plays a crucial role in production:

- **Handles HTTP/HTTPS Traffic**: It listens for incoming requests on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) and directs them to the appropriate internal services (e.g., the video streaming service or media storage).
- **SSL Management**: Traefik automates the management of SSL certificates for secure communication with users.
- **Service Discovery**: Using Docker's provider integration, Traefik automatically detects and configures routing for new or modified services, ensuring smooth scaling and updates.

## Usage in Production

Traefik is deployed in the production environment as part of the Docker infrastructure. It communicates with other services through shared Docker networks and ensures that each service is exposed correctly to the outside world. Traefik manages both internal and external networking, ensuring that:

- Internal services remain private and accessible only within the internal network.
- Public-facing services, such as the video player and API, are securely accessible via public URLs.

## Networks

In the **Personal Cinema** project, Traefik operates across several networks:

- **Backend network**: Used for internal communication between backend services.
- **Frontend network**: Handles public traffic for frontend services.
- **Admin network**: Manages access to administrative services.
- **CDN Backend network**: Manages communication between Traefik and content delivery services for media files.
